# ü•ó ChippyWellFest

A single page Jekyll website for ChippyWellFest, that uses pre-defined [run scripts](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/run/) to either serve or build the website, then (for now) manually deploying to Netlify.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è General notes

* Speaker data, like most data is stored in the `_data` folder in YAML `.yml` format, you will edit this information to update speaker data and other raw data.
* There are some commented out speakers (`speaker-profiles.yaml`) as we don't have sufficient information.
* Place images in the `img` directory located in the root folder and Gulp will:
    * Minify.
    * Create `.webp` images from the `.jpg` files.
    * Move to necessary directory.
* `speaker-single.json` is test data, and not used.
* `netlify.toml` is not used yet, will be when continuous integration is setup.
